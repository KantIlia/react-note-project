Hi, welcome to my learning project "Notes" created using React.js. This marks my initial venture into React. Within this application, you can add, modify, and delete notes. Future plans involve creating an archive for version 4.01 and implementing note-saving functionality on the server.

In version 3.01, I've undertaken refactoring efforts. 

For insights into the project's logic and structure, refer to:

 ## to do list
 to do list is list of functhions and methods that i use but hfve no clear understanding
 - !text.trim()
 - useReducer dont understand synaksis of this but i think this metod will help me... => its state manager but in thus pj i shoose gorizontal structure
 - make 8 - archiv - button to put in array archuv - think about router
 - mil 7   i dont now why but output work withiout any changes(my output take new item each time when save buuton works but we download array from local storeg and its dispayd without any specific functhions - okey i will check how its work)
